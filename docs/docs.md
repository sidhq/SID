Comment: This is just a knowledge dump for now.
Here are important links:
All demos are accessible at *.demo.sid.ai
for example: simple-chat.demo.sid.ai
or: personal-agent.demo.sid.ai
each project maps to repos such as SID/examples/personal-agent or SID/examples/simple-chat
this is supposed to be turned into a structured doc at some point. for now we just do docs/docs.md,
but in the future we will actually use something like:
docusaurus (algolia/react native/supabase, seems to be close to YC)
mkdocs (no idea)
readthedocs (lmql/langchain, used by AI/python projects)
nextra.site (node.js, next.js, used by 'modern' looking web/frontend tools/js frameworks)
